# CAPUEE Lab 4, Communication
The main goal of the project is to send the data we collect from our Arduino to a computer such as the Raspberry PI or our laptop, and create an output file to store the historic data. Also, we will be able to control the Arduino relay with commands from the computer.
The lab is divided in 2 parts:
In the first one, we will send data collected from the Arduino to the computer, developing a code.  Furthermore, we will program the computer to read data from the serial port and store it. Later, we will use a Python script to read this data using our Arduino and store it.
In the second part, the computer will send a command to open or close the relay, and the Arduino will be programmed to read this instruction and control the relay accordingly.  In this case, we will do with a Python script.
